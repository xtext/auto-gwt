Auto-GWT
========

Auto-GWT is a library for GWT that eleminates all superfluous boilerplate from typical GWT idioms and boosts the tool integration to a new level. It's a library for Xtend (http://www.xtendlang.org), which is a dense, thin but powerful language over Java. It translates to readable Java source code.

See the website for more info : http://www.auto-gwt.org

Getting Started
===============

Auto-GWT is built with Maven, so simply clone the repository and run `mvn clean install` in the rrot directory.

Example
=======

Checkout https://github.com/DJCordhose/todomvc-xtend-gwt to see how Auto-GWT is used in GWT project.
Note that, although this example is completely written in Xtend it is not reuired, you can mix and match Xtend and Java as you wish.

IDE
===
We currently recommend to use Eclipse since the IntelliJ plug-in for Xtend is not yet available (first beta release soon).
Go to http://xtendlang.org and download either the full IDE or use the updatesite to install the Xtend SDK into your existing Eclipse. The Google Plug-in for Eclipse is not required.
